speaker_experience:
  - 'So far, I only presented at my local Scala Meetup. I presented "An introduction to Slick", "An introduction to Scala.js" and an early version of the talk I intend to present called "My first funcional validator" (Slides in Spanish: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eLrQFgjNSP_Qk-8BVwUEJtn3tvK38KgPbhCK-Ffykyk/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eLrQFgjNSP_Qk-8BVwUEJtn3tvK38KgPbhCK-Ffykyk/edit?usp=sharing</a>)'
