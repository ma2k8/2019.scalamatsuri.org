**Let's make our own Intellectual Highway!**

In our house, Amazon Echo is used for Smart Home and we use our own Slack for family communication. However,the Bots running on them are my original creation, written in Scala from scratch.

Why did I bother reinventing the wheel and what am I gaining from this?
Why do I think hacking everyday items is the best way to study programming over any other method?

In this session, I will discuss **what I learned about learning** through the following topics:

- Actual case studies and lessons learned
- My own journey through Future and Free Monad etc
- Intentional wheel reinvention should be called **intellectual launchpad** instead

Not too much Scala in this talk.
