Speakers are essential to a conference. However, they shouldn't be limited to the famed, the greats, and the cool kids. When considering the progress of the community, it's crucial to have fresh speakers.

I would like to discuss my own experience of responding to a CFP for a conference, getting selected, and giving a talk as a 40-something nobody engineer. -- What do you need to become a speaker? Why should you try giving a talk? What happens (and what doesn't) when you give a talk?
