Numeric programming is a notoriously difficult topic. For number crunching we need raw performance. However, using floating-point numbers may lead to inaccurate results. As functional programmers, we’d really like to abstract over concrete number types, which is where abstract algebra comes into play. This interplay between abstract and concrete is what makes good library support necessary for writing fast & correct programs. Spire is such a library. This talk will be an introduction to Spire, showcasing the “number tower”, real-ish numbers and how to obey the law.
