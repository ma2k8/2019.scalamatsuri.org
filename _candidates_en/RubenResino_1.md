Create a new API at this moment is so easy, use Scala is easy, for use Functional Programming you need a some experience, but create a Scala API using Functional Programming for Big Data proposses IS A BIG CHALLENGE.
I will show you how create a new API for Big Data, how to choose the best tools and how to avoid a lot of pitfalls. 
This talk will get a lot of suggestions and I will show how Functional Programming (FP) will solve a lot of problems, but sometimes FP can be hard to make simple things, and how to solve this problems.
